# Auction-Platform-For-Practically-Everything

The project is currently only HTML, CSS and basic JS. The Front-end covers the 70% of the entire project. This basically the preview of how the project will look after completion.

Need: 

In the wake of pandemic, common public has felt the urge of a platform where we can sell any of our items and also buy the ones we need at the moment

Our Spaces always have an object in a functional state, but doesn’t serve any purpose to us anymore. Our Households also require certain objects, which are heavy to afford in fresh state.

Online services like Ebay, OLX, etx. does provide the solution to some extent, but none of them provides the best satisfying price to the seller and Trust & Transparency to the customer. We intend to build a webapp, where one can auction practically anything in a functional state. Also we will make sure that most of the processes are online with least physical interaction

The webapp will also contain jobs & services auctions, which will ensure that a service is neither underpaid or overpaid, but perfectly according to the public demand. 

Vision:

•	To build an Auction Webapp Platform, where one can sell anything in proper state with required buyable capacity at the best price.

•	Updating the best price for the product in real-time.


•	Any object in a sellable state, can be registered for auction by any user with certain verifications.

•	Customer (or Buyer) should only set the price higher than the best price, only if he is ABLE to afford. One also can set any other price they find the product suitable for; in case the highest buyer steps back at the last stage.


•	Simply anyone can set any price for the product they think is suitable; making the platform interactive and user-friendly.

•	Maintaining Trust & Transparency using Blockchain. 

The Product Auction:

Any object in a sellable state, can be registered for auction by any user with certain verifications. It includes performing product verification twice, initially and ultimately, using all-round images and videos with several questions. Only genuine products can be registered.

Customer (or Buyer) should only set the price higher than the best price, only IF he/she is ABLE to afford. One also can set any other price they find the product suitable for (known as average price); in case the highest buyer steps back at the last stage.

Simply anyone can set any price for the product they think is suitable; making the platform interactive and user-friendly.

If a user tries to set a futile price to manipulate the average or best price, he/she will be permanantly banned from the platform.  

The seller must set the auction time limit and the initial price, and can extend it only once if the best price is unsatisfying. Once the deadline is reached, the product will sold according to the best price. 

The seller is also highly expected to answer the user queires and verification demands. Lower ratings and feedbacks can terminate the auction with proper examination.

The viewer can enter his/her suitable value. It can be the best or customary value, and also lower than the initial value set by the seller. 

The Seller can re-auction or cancel the auction if the price isn’t satisfying. If the best price is lower than the initial price, the seller can cancel the auctioning or extend. Otherwise he/she must be willing to ship the product given the product is still in the initial state by verification.

Jobs & Services Auction: 

Right-paid job is not only a matter of concern for an employee but also the employer. If an unemployed needs a job with highest salary, the employer needs someone with least salary

The only difference will be that all the auctions made will be functional and visible to the employer, similar to hiring process. Later on, the registerer can select any number of postings which meet their salary criteria for the interviewing process. 

The employer can post a job for a single or n number of employees with the maximum salary he/she can afford to pay.

The employee can set any price lower than the initial price. They can also set literally any amount, which can be greater than the maximum demand, which will be considered as a demand to hike and can be taked seriously in certain cases.

This section will not only contain long-term employement but also short-term single event service. For eg. A person can create an auction for the service they want like helping in shifting their home, helping the old-age in gardening, driving for someone. The remaining processes will be similar to jobs auction.

The helper will be strongly responsible and accoutable for any real life violation with the help of identity verifications.

Considering this the jobs and services area will be divided into two sections i.e jobs auction and services auction.
